                  (as phones-value :phone))
          (inner-join [table-phones (on (:= phones-client clients-id))]
                      [table-emails (on (:= emails-client clients-id))])
          (where (:and (:in clients-id [2 4])
                       (:not (:= emails-value "spammer@hacker.org"))))
          (order [clients-id :desc])
          (limit 20)))

=> ({:phone "+2222222", :email "client2@somewere.com", :name "client2"}
    {:phone "+2221111", :email "client2@somewere.com", :name "client2"}
    {:phone "+2220000", :email "client2@somewere.com", :name "client2"})
